# hello-world
My first Git Hub Project's repository 

Hi, Tom here.

New to GetHub and using it as my first step in FreeCodeCamp. I'm a long-time computer user and actually teach many computer classes from Adobe CC software, to iOS devices, Macs, and PCs. I've programmed in Basic, COBOL, and Fortrans but that is way back from the '70s and '80s so this stuff is all new to me.
